Daily Planner
```
This daily planner has the date at the top, and timeblocks for most conceivable work hours in a normal day.
Hours in the present are highlighted in pink, hours in the past are greyed out, hours in the future are green.  The user can click in the hour's area, then hit save to save an appointment, and can erase it and save again to clear it out.
